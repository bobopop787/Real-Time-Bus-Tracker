# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This project tracks the position of buses in Boston using MBTA's API. It also shows the stops between MIT and Harvard.

## How to use
Clicking the **Show stops between MIT and Harvard** will animate a green marker showing each stop between MIT and Harvard. The red markers show the current position of buses that are currently in service. Note that this only updates every 20 seconds.

## Future Improvement
- Making it so that text appears after a marker is clicked so that it shows more information about the bus
- Make a button that shows the history of the routes buses have taken
